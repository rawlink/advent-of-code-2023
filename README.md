# Advent of Code 2023
https://adventofcode.com/2023

Good old fashioned Christmas coding fun. There should be a readme for each day copied straight from the AOC 2023 description.
Each day should have Python doctests for the sample data as well as an assertion of the actual puzzle's results to further
ensure that a refactor doesn't break functionality.

Each day will print out part 1 and 2 answers. Doctests are executed by running something similar to `python3 -m doctest -v day1.py`.
